# Analysis and Visualization of COVID-19 Mortality In Selected Countries of The Americas

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global economic, political, and societal structures, with substantial loss of life. Understanding the impact of the pandemic in terms of mortality in different regions and demographics is crucial to developing effective public health strategies and
policies. This project aims to analyze mortality related to COVID-19 in the Americas, leveraging open data mainly from government sources. The focus is on exploring differences in mortality outcomes, both in absolute terms and relative to population size, with a particular emphasis on comparing COVID-19 mortality between Hispanic nations and the Hispanic population within the United States.
